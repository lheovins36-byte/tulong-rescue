  </header>

  <div class="container">
    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how the <strong>T.U.L.O.N.G Rescue Application</strong> (the "App"), developed for Cauayan City by Isabela State University, collects, uses, stores, shares, and protects personal information. It describes the rights of users and responders and how to contact the project data steward.</p>

    <h2>1. Scope</h2>
    <p>This policy applies to all users of the App (citizens, barangay volunteers, verified responders, and administrators) and to data collected by the App and the associated admin dashboard.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect only the information necessary to deliver emergency services and to operate and improve the App:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Device & Location data:</strong> GPS coordinates, device accuracy, timestamp of SOS activation, and limited device metadata required for routing and dispatch.</li>
      <li><strong>User profile:</strong> name, phone number, barangay, role (user, volunteer, rescuer), and optional profile photo and credentials for responders.</li>
      <li><strong>Incident data:</strong> incident type (e.g., medical, fire, accident), optional short description, optional photo or short video uploaded by the user, and responder status updates (accepted, en route, completed).</li>
      <li><strong>Usage & Analytics:</strong> aggregated, anonymized metrics (e.g., number of alerts, median time-to-dispatch) used for dashboards and planning.</li>
      <li><strong>Logs:</strong> system logs and timestamps for performance monitoring and auditing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Purpose of Processing</h2>
    <p>We process data for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Dispatching and coordinating emergency response to the location supplied by the user;</li>
      <li>Allowing verified responders to accept and update incident status;</li>
      <li>Providing real-time admin dashboard views to LGU DRRM officers for operational decision-making;</li>
      <li>Improving service quality through analytics and short-term forecasting;</li>
      <li>Fulfilling legal or safety obligations (e.g., incident reporting).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Legal Basis and Consent</h2>
    <p>By using the App and tapping SOS, users give explicit consent to process the data necessary to provide emergency assistance. Processing is also supported by legitimate public interest in protecting life and safety and by compliance with applicable laws such as the Philippines Data Privacy Act (RA 10173).</p>

    <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We share data only as needed to deliver services:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To verified responders and LGU officials for incident response;</li>
      <li>To partner agencies (e.g., municipal health units, BFP, PNP) when required for coordination;</li>
      <li>To analytics systems in aggregated or pseudonymized form (not identifying individuals);</li>
      <li>We do not sell personal data to third parties.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Photos, Video & Sensitive Data</h2>
    <p>Media uploads (photos/videos) may contain sensitive personal data. Users are asked for consent before uploading. Where possible, media is stored encrypted and retained only as long as operationally necessary. The App supports automatic expiry/deletion of media unless retention is required for investigation or legal reasons.</p>

    <h2>7. Retention</h2>
    <p>Incident records and logs are retained according to the following default schedule unless a longer period is required by law:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Raw incident records (including media): retained for up to 180 days then archived or deleted unless required for investigation;</li>
      <li>Aggregated analytics: retained indefinitely in anonymized form for planning and forecasting;</li>
      <li>Responder credentials: retained while the responder is active and for up to 2 years after deactivation for audit purposes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Security Measures</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect data:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Encryption in transit (TLS) and at rest for sensitive fields and media;</li>
      <li>Role-based access control (admins, dispatchers, responders) with logging and audit trails;</li>
      <li>Regular backups and secure key management;</li>
      <li>Device-level protections: token-based authentication for responder devices;</li>
      <li>Periodic security reviews and incident response planning.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Offline Operation and Queueing</h2>
    <p>The App supports offline queue-and-forward: SOS activations created offline are stored locally, timestamped, and transmitted automatically when connectivity resumes. Local queued data persists only until transmission and is deleted afterward, except when legal or operational retention is required.</p>

    <h2>10. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Under RA 10173 and related data protection principles, you have rights including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Right to be informed about processing and purpose;</li>
      <li>Right to access your personal data;</li>
      <li>Right to request correction of inaccurate data;</li>
      <li>Right to object to or restrict processing in certain situations;</li>
      <li>Right to have data deleted where there is no legal basis for retention (subject to exceptions for emergency response or legal obligations).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To exercise these rights, contact the Data Steward below. We will respond in accordance with applicable law.</p>

    <h2>11. Minors and Vulnerable Users</h2>
    <p>The App is intended for general public use. Minors may use the App in emergencies; parental consent rules apply to any profile creation that collects personal data beyond emergency activation.</p>

    <h2>12. Changes to this Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we make material changes, we will display an in-app notice and update the effective date above.</p>
